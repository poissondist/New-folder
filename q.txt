    How to deal with data leak
    can you explain the ML 
    how you allocate yourtime to these stages?
    categorical data?
    overfitting and underfitting?
    Model explainability
    explain your fav model in layman's term
    between a linear model, a neural network, and a tree-based model, which one do you select for modelling?
    how do you keep yourself updated for new technologies and trends?
    Do stay updated with competitions
    in your opinion, what's the most important: being a good communicaotr or good listener
    What they expect in this role?
    what are steps in a research problem?
    Did you come across a situation where you proposed something and it was not accepted? If so how did you deal with that?
    how to handle unbalanced data?
    How to aviod overfitting ? how to avoid underfitting?
